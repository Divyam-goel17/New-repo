# Task1
This task is complementary to the Git and GitHub Fundamentals task.

Unfortunately, when we designed these tasks, we weren't sure of using GitHub classroom, so we didn't create our tasks' documentation in a markdown file.
You may find the following Google doc which can be accessed through any account of the BITS Pilani University.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eayzx_zXlV_NYZd3iPJQxX8pwIoCvdeeK8k2_JvBdrE/edit?usp=sharing

You are to read through the entire document thoroughly, understand it and follow the walk through. You may find the task at the end of the doc. Please add the expected task submissions to this repository and commit it to the main branch.

However, ideally it is good practice to commit to new branch, open a PR, and merge it. As an excercise, you may also create a new branch, commit to it, open a pull request, and merge it with main. However, we will only be able to record the changes made to the main branch, and by default only the main branch will be considered for evaluation. If you feel like this is getting too complicated just commit to the main branch for the time being and you can try this out when you feel more comfortable.
